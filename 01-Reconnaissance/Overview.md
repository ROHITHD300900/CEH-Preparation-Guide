# Reconnaissance & Footprinting

## Introduction
Reconnaissance is the first phase of ethical hacking and penetration testing. It involves gathering information about the target system with the goal of identifying potential vulnerabilities.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**
- Information gathering from public sources
- No direct contact with target
- Includes social media, public records, DNS records, whois data

### 2. **Types of Reconnaissance**

#### **Passive Reconnaissance**
- Indirect information gathering
- No direct contact with target
- Tools: WHOIS, DNS lookup, Google dorking
- Risk Level: Low

#### **Active Reconnaissance**
- Direct contact with target systems
- Scanning and probing
- Tools: Nmap, Traceroute, Ping
- Risk Level: High (may trigger IDS/IPS alerts)

## Important Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Type |
|------|---------|------|
| **WHOIS** | Domain registration info | Passive |
| **Nslookup** | DNS queries | Passive |
| **Nmap** | Port scanning | Active |
| **Traceroute** | Network path mapping | Active |
| **Shodan** | Search engine for devices | Passive |

## Learning Outcomes
